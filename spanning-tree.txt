TWO CONNECTED SWITCHES BOOT AT THE SAME TIME

// known behaviors //
port types
    calculated and assigned immediately, regardless of port state
        (example: can be ROOT port type while in LISTENING state)
stp is never 'at rest', maintains state machine for each stp instance and participating interface indefinitely
    timer based
    who is root bridge?
    which port should be root?
    triggers
        topology change and notification BPDUs
        other conditions can signal changes and trigger recalculations
            BPDUs stop arriving on interface beyond max age timer
            optional features

// port states //
disabled
    if administratively shutdown, will not participate
    otherwise ports are disabled while being initialized by operating system until transition to 'connected'
blocking
    receives BPDUs, forwards to switch module
    any port state can transition to blocking immediately, no timer waits required
    blocking can transition to listening immediately, no timer waits required
        disabled <- -> blocking
        forwarding -> blocking
        listening <- -> blocking
        learning -> blocking
        forwarding -> blocking
        in thought experiment, two connected switches transition to blocking and then listening immediately
listening
    starts forward delay timer (15 sec)
    receives BPDUs
    decides best bpdu
    sends best bpdu
        either self-originated or relayed (in our experiment both switches think they are root and send BPDUs)
    evaluates next state, assumes learning, transitions at end of timer
    if determined
learning
    sends and receives BPDUS
    can transition to blocking immediately if port
    learns mac addresses

maximum diameter: recommended 7
maximum bridge transit delay: considered to be 1 second
